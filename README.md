# Data Science Learning Journey – Day 1 & 2

Welcome to my step-by-step learning journey into the world of **Data Science using Python**. This repository contains my hands-on notebooks and key concepts explored during the early days of this journey.

---

## Day 1 – NumPy Basics (`numpy.ipynb`)

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array Indexing, Slicing, and Reshaping
- Broadcasting and Element-wise Operations
- Useful Functions: `arange()`, `linspace()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`
- Comparison between NumPy arrays vs Python lists

### Use Case:
NumPy is foundational for **scientific computing** and **image processing**. Arrays allow fast pixel manipulation, numerical modeling, and data transformations.

## Day 2 – Pandas Basics (`pandas.ipynb`)

### Topics Covered:
- Series and DataFrame structures
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Using `map()`, `apply()`, and `lambda` for feature engineering
- File operations 
- Mini use-cases on custom logic and column operations

### Use Case:
Pandas helps with real-world **data analysis and preparation** — transforming raw CSV data into insightful and clean datasets.
