# NumPy Basics – Day 1 of Learning Journey

Welcome to the first notebook of my learning series on **CV, NLP & MLOps**. This repository marks the beginning of my journey with **NumPy**, the fundamental package for numerical computation in Python.

## What’s Inside – `numpy.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook covers the foundational concepts of NumPy:

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to NumPy
- Difference between Python Lists and NumPy Arrays
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array Indexing and Slicing
- Reshaping and Flattening Arrays
- Data Types and Conversion
- Array Operations (Arithmetic, Comparison, Broadcasting)
- Useful NumPy Functions:
  - `arange()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`
  - `reshape()`, `flatten()`
  - `mean()`, `sum()`, `std()`, `min()`, `max()`
- Vectorization vs Looping (Speed Comparison)

## Why NumPy for Images?

NumPy plays a major role in **image processing**:
- Images can be represented as **multi-dimensional arrays** (2D for grayscale, 3D for RGB).
- Enables fast and efficient pixel-level manipulation.
- Forms the foundation for working with libraries like OpenCV, PIL, and TensorFlow/Keras.

> Example: An RGB image of size 256x256 becomes a NumPy array of shape `(256, 256, 3)`
